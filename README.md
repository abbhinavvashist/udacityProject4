•	Test your project code using linting: make lint 
•	Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application: ./run_docker.sh 
•	Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction: ./make_prediction.sh 
•	Improve the log statements in the source code for this application: see output in ./output_text_files/docker_out.txt 
•	Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster: ./upload_docker.sh 
•	Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction: ./run_kubernetes.sh AND ./make_prediction.sh 
•	Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested: [https://github.com/abbhinavvashist/udacityProject4.git]
•	Output file: ./output_txt_files/docker_out.txt contains results from "add at least one log statement to app.py that prints out the output prediction values and ./run_docker.sh again"
•	Output file: ./output_txt_files/kubernetes_out.txt contains results from "Copy the text output after calling run_kubernetes.sh and paste it into a file kubernetes_out.txt."
