[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/abbhinavvashist/udacityProject4/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/abbhinavvashist/udacityProject4/tree/main)

1 - Test your project code using linting: make lint
2 - Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application: ./run_docker.sh
3 - Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction: ./make_prediction.sh
4 - Improve the log statements in the source code for this application: see output in ./output_text_files/docker_out.txt
5 - Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster: ./upload_docker.sh
6 - Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction: ./run_kubernetes.sh AND ./make_prediction.sh
7 - Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested: [https://github.com/abbhinavvashist/udacityProject4.git]

Output file: ./output_txt_files/docker_out.txt contains results from "add at least one log statement to app.py that prints out the output prediction values and ./run_docker.sh again"

Output file: ./output_txt_files/kubernetes_out.txt contains results from "Copy the text output after calling run_kubernetes.sh and paste it into a file kubernetes_out.txt."
